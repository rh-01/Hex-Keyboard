# Notes
- The fourth gate in the Input Selector could be used to replace the Enter button (for RAM), but then you can not swith through the selector anymore without entering whatever value currently is in the buffers.
- In the Key Encoder schematic, the first 4-OR gate was replaced by two 2-OR gates (there was a problem in the simulation using a 4-OR) and the second 4-OR gate is shown as a 5-OR gate (which in reality is a 4-OR gate combined with a 2-OR gate).

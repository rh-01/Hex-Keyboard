# Notes
- The fourth NAND gate in the Input Selector could be used to replace the Enter button (for RAM), but then you can not switch through the selector anymore without entering whatever value currently is in the buffers.
- In the Key Encoder schematic, the first 4-OR gate was replaced by two 2-OR gates (there was a problem in the software simulation using a 4-OR) and the second 4-OR gate is shown as a 5-OR gate (which in reality is a 4-OR gate combined with a 2-OR gate).
- The 74HC125 consists of four 3-state buffers (three of which are used), but in the Signal Router schematic I only placed a symbol next to the middle one.

  I'll replace the schematics with more descriptive ones once I have a bit more time.
